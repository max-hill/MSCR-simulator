* Preliminary notes
In this document, we record experiments performed with the generalized simulator
on trees with four leaves. This simulator is significantly faster than the
original simulator and scales better with sequence length k. Note that A,B,C,D
equal 1,2,3,4 respectively. On unbalanced trees, the more recent internal branch
has length *f₁* and the other internal branch has length *f₂*. On balanced
trees, the internal branch ancestral to populations A and B has length *f₁*
whereas *f₂* denotes the length of the other internal branch.

Consistent with results from the the three-taxa simulations, we find that the
effect disappears for edges of length greater than 1/10 of a coalescent unit. 
* Experiment 1 - Unbalanced Quartet Tree

Unbalanced tree with negligible f₁ and topology (((A,B),C),D). High recombination in
A and B. The true quartet is least likely to be inferred.

The results here are essentially the same as the previous case, in which there
is no recombination. This is consistent with previous three-taxa simulations in
which we found the effects disappear when internal branches have length at least
~0.1 coalescent units.
